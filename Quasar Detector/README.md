#Project Background

Galaxies and QSOs (Quasi-Stellar Objects) are distinct types of astronomical objects characterized by their unique color signatures. This project aims to develop and compare two classification approaches:

	•	A custom neural network designed and implemented in Python.
	•	A random forest classifier as a baseline comparison.

Approach

	•	Data Preprocessing: Performing necessary feature engineering on the dataset to prepare it for classification.
	•	Custom Neural Network: Designing and coding a neural network architecture suitable for classifying galaxies and QSOs based on their color features.
	•	Random Forest Classifier: Implementing and evaluating a random forest classifier for comparison with the neural network approach.
	•	Performance Evaluation: Using appropriate metrics to fine-tune hyperparameters and compare the classification performance of both models.

#Dataset Overview

The dataset (galaxy_qso_data.csv) contains color measurements of objects classified as galaxies and QSOs. This data is utilized for training and evaluating the classification models in the project.

#Usage Instructions

To explore or replicate this project within your portfolio repository:

	1.	Clone the repository containing this folder.
	2.	Ensure Python and necessary libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) are installed.
	3.	Open and run Quasar Detector.py in a Jupyter environment to review the methodology, implementation details, results, and performance analysis of the neural network and random forest classifiers.

#Conclusion

This project demonstrates my proficiency in applying machine learning techniques to astronomical data analysis, specifically in the classification of galaxies and QSOs based on color features. The comparison between a custom neural network and a random forest classifier provides insights into the effectiveness of different approaches for this classification task.
