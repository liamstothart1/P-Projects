# Passion Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository of passion projects! This directory showcases a variety of personal projects that I've created to explore new technologies, improve my skills, and have fun with coding. Each project is unique and represents a different area of interest or a new challenge I've taken on. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project along with links to their respective folders.

## Projects

- [Credit Risk Model](.P-Projects/CreditRiskModel)

## Project Overviews

### Credit risk classifier
A credit risk model is a financial tool used to estimate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan or credit obligation. These models are essential for financial institutions as they help in assessing the risk associated with lending and making informed decisions about credit issuance. Hereâ€™s a short overview of a typical credit risk model:

Purpose

The primary purpose of a credit risk model is to predict the probability of default (PD) and to estimate the potential loss (Loss Given Default, LGD) in the event of a default. This allows lenders to manage their risk exposure and set appropriate interest rates and credit limits.

## How to Use

Each project folder contains a `README.md` file with detailed information on the project's purpose, technologies used, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and contribute if you're interested!


## Contact

You can reach me at [your-email@example.com] I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and discuss new ideas.

Thank you for visiting my repository. Happy coding!
