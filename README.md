# Passion Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository of passion projects! This directory showcases a variety of personal projects that I've created to explore new technologies, improve my skills, and have fun with coding. Each project is unique and represents a different area of interest or a new challenge I've taken on. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project along with links to their respective folders.

## Projects

- Credit Risk Model
- Homemade Neural Network

## Project Overviews

### Credit risk classifier
A credit risk model is a financial tool used to estimate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan or credit obligation. These models are essential for financial institutions as they help in assessing the risk associated with lending and making informed decisions about credit issuance. Hereâ€™s a short overview of a typical credit risk model:

Purpose

The primary purpose of a credit risk model is to predict the probability of default (PD) and to estimate the potential loss (Loss Given Default, LGD) in the event of a default. This allows lenders to manage their risk exposure and set appropriate interest rates and credit limits.

# Simple Neural Network Framework

This repository contains an implementation of a neural network framework in Python. It includes classes for creating neural network layers and the neural network itself, functions for training the network using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and methods for evaluating and visualizing performance. It can serve as guide for how neural networks function and their parts.

## Features

- **Layer Class**: Represents a single neural network layer with forward and backward propagation methods.
- **NeuralNetwork Class**: Represents a neural network composed of multiple layers.
- **Validation Curve**: Function to plot training and testing accuracy over epochs.
- **Layer Testing**: Method to test different layer configurations and save performance data to a CSV file.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas

## How to Use

Each project folder contains a `README.md` file with detailed information on the project's purpose, technologies used, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and contribute if you're interested!


## Contact

You can reach me at [your-email@example.com] I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and discuss new ideas.

Thank you for visiting my repository. Happy coding!
