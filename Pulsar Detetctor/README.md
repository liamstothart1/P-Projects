#Introduction

Welcome to the Pulsar Detection project. This section provides an overview of the contents and purpose of the files related to pulsar detection using machine learning techniques.

#Contents

	1.	Pulsar Detector.py
	•	This Jupyter notebook contains detailed implementations of a random forest classifier for identifying real pulsars from radio frequency interference (RFI) noise. It includes code cells, model training, evaluation, and insights derived from the results.
	2.	data/
	•	pulsar.csv: This CSV file stores the dataset utilized for training and evaluating the pulsar detection model. It contains measurements of critical features extracted from integrated pulse profiles and dispersion measure - signal strength curves of pulsar candidates and RFI noise samples.

¢Project Background

Neutron stars, remnants of supernovae, emit periodic radio waves that can be observed on Earth. However, these signals are often obscured by RFI from various terrestrial sources. The goal of this project is to develop a robust classification model that can accurately distinguish genuine pulsar signals from RFI noise using machine learning.

Approach

	•	Feature Extraction: Extracting features such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis from integrated pulse profiles and DM-signal strength curves.
	•	Machine Learning Model: Utilizing a random forest classifier implemented in Python’s scikit-learn library to classify pulsar candidates based on extracted features.

#Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project, derived from the HTRU2 dataset, comprises measurements from 1,639 known pulsars and 16,259 candidate pulsars initially identified as RFI noise. Detailed descriptions of these measurements can be found in the associated research paper.
